# Space Properties Popup Update

## Changes Made

The popup window functionality has been updated to show only the specific property type (Public or Protected) that was clicked, rather than showing both types together.

### Key Changes:

1. **Property Type Tracking**
   - Added `popupType` property to track which type ('public' or 'protected') is being shown
   - The popup now remembers which button was clicked

2. **Smart Toggle Behavior**
   - Clicking the same popup button twice will close the popup
   - Clicking a different popup button will switch to that property type
   - Each property type gets its own dedicated popup view

3. **Dynamic Content**
   - Popup title changes based on type: "Public Properties" or "Protected Properties"
   - Only the relevant property section is shown in the popup
   - Input fields and buttons are dynamically generated for the specific type

4. **Optimized Layout**
   - Reduced default popup size from 600x500px to 500x400px since only one section is shown
   - Cleaner, more focused interface for property management

## Usage

1. **Opening a Popup**
   - Click the ⛶ button next to "Public Properties" to open only public properties in a popup
   - Click the ⛶ button next to "Protected Properties" to open only protected properties in a popup

2. **Switching Between Types**
   - While a popup is open, clicking the other property type's ⛶ button will switch the popup to that type
   - No need to close and reopen - it transitions smoothly

3. **Closing the Popup**
   - Click the × button in the popup header
   - Or click the same ⛶ button again to toggle it closed
   - The inline panel automatically reappears when the popup closes

## Benefits

- **Focused View**: Users can concentrate on one property type at a time
- **Less Clutter**: Smaller popup window with only relevant information
- **Better Organization**: Each property type gets its own dedicated space
- **Improved Usability**: Clear visual separation between public and protected properties

## Technical Implementation

The implementation follows these principles:
- State management tracks both `isPopupOpen` and `popupType`
- Dynamic HTML generation based on the selected type
- Event listeners are conditionally attached based on property type
- Render methods check the popup type to display appropriate content
